XMLSource
=========

The xml source adapter adapts IXMLRepresentation to IXMLSource. Let's make sure
processing instructions which are not inside the document tree are preserverd
Create a dummy object:

>>> import lxml.objectify
>>> class XML:
...     xml = lxml.objectify.fromstring('<a/><?foo?>')


Call the adapter factory -- the PI is still there. We also get the XML
declaration:

>>> import zeit.cms.content.adapter
>>> print(zeit.cms.content.adapter.xml_source(XML()))
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<a/>
<?foo?>
