    * Create an interface with which all content objects inside the folder
      shall be marked. Must inherit from ISectionMarker.
      Register it as an adapter from IMySection to ISectionMarker.
    * (Optional) Create interfaces with which specific content types
      inside the folder shall be marked. Must inherit from ISectionMarker.
      Register these as an adapter from IMySection to ISectionMarker,
      with the type identifier as the adapter name.
