Publication Status
===================

An object can generally be published or not. But when it's published there may
be local changes, which have not been published[#functional]_

Note: since publishing itself takes a while (and may modify the object in the
process, thus setting a new modified timestamp), the comparison includes a
fudge factor. For this test we remove that (to increase readability):

>>> import zeit.cms.workflow.interfaces
>>> old_grace = zeit.cms.workflow.interfaces.PUBLISH_DURATION_GRACE
>>> zeit.cms.workflow.interfaces.PUBLISH_DURATION_GRACE = 0

Initially content is not published:

>>> import zeit.cms.interfaces
>>> content = zeit.cms.interfaces.ICMSContent(
...     'http://xml.zeit.de/testcontent')
>>> status = zeit.cms.workflow.interfaces.IPublicationStatus(content)
>>> status.published
'not-published'

The content was modified last at the following time:

>>> import zope.dublincore.interfaces
>>> times = zope.dublincore.interfaces.IDCTimes(content)
>>> times.modified
datetime.datetime(2008, 3, 7, 12, 47, 16, tzinfo=<UTC>)

When we publish the object after that time, the publication status indicates
that accordingly:

>>> import datetime
>>> zeit.cms.workflow.mock._published[content.uniqueId] = True
>>> zeit.cms.workflow.mock._publish_times[content.uniqueId] = (
...     times.modified + datetime.timedelta(seconds=5))
>>> status.published
'published'


When the publication date is before the last modification, this will be
indicated as well:

>>> zeit.cms.workflow.mock._publish_times[content.uniqueId] = (
...     times.modified + datetime.timedelta(seconds=-5))
>>> status.published
'published-with-changes'


Clean up:

>>> zeit.cms.workflow.mock._published.clear()
>>> zeit.cms.workflow.mock._publish_times.clear()
>>> zeit.cms.workflow.interfaces.PUBLISH_DURATION_GRACE = old_grace


.. [#functional]

    >>> import zeit.cms.testing
    >>> zeit.cms.testing.set_site()
    >>> principal = zeit.cms.testing.create_interaction()
