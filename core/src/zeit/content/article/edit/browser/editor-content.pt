    XXX 1. Visually, the margin (to make room for the heading) would work on
    #cp-content-inner, but doing it like that breaks Selenium DnD.
    Thus, we need to put the margin on #cp-content.
    2. As long as the heading is only present for Articles, we only
    want the extra margin on #cp-content in the Article editor.
    But, CSS does not have a "parent" selector, so we can't express
        $('.article-editor-inner').parent('#cp-content')
    so we put the rule inline in here.

  <style type="text/css">
  #cp-content {
    margin-top: 25px;
  }
  </style>
