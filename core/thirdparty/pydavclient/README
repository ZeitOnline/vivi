pydavclient is a package which helps in accessing resources published
via the WebDAV protocol. It provides a set of classes which directly
refer to the resource wanted.

It requires libxml2 and it's Python bindings.

To test the classes use the test.py script and give a WebDAV enabled
URI to it as a parameter.

For now, there won't be an official release.

To get the newest version checkout:
