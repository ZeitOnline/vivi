CHANGES
=======

2.10.3 (unreleased)
-------------------

- BUG-791: listCollection() no longer ignores childname entries that
  don't exist in the property cache, since we cannot decide whether
  they're actually gone at that point, only when they are actually
  accessed (so zeit.cms.repository values() takes over that duty).


2.10.2 (2017-08-18)
-------------------

- MAINT: Add package version to our user agent header


2.10.1 (2017-07-04)

2.7.4 (2015-11-17)
------------------

- Ignore strange filenames like `._foo.jpg.meta` properly.


2.7.3 (2015-10-30)
------------------

- Change ``search()`` error to a log.warning instead of a NotImplementedError,
  so it does not disturb zeit.web production.


2.7.2 (2015-10-23)
------------------

- Cache canonical ids (transaction-bound) in filesystem connector.


2.7.1 (2015-10-23)

------------------

- Add transaction-bound caching to filesystem connector.

- Make canonicalizing directory uniqueIds configurable in filesystem connector
  via product config ``zeit.connector:canonicalize-directories = False``
  (defaults to True which is the behaviour since 2.4.0).


2.6.9 (2015-09-25)
------------------

- Fix off-by-one error in cache sweeper.


2.6.8 (2015-09-24)
------------------

------------------

- Commit sweeps every 100 items to avoid conflict errors.


2.6.6 (2015-08-27)
------------------

- Catch bad request exceptions and terminate traversal (ZON-2062).


2.6.5 (2015-08-13)
------------------

- Generalize treatment of folder content-types in filesystem connector,
  instead of hard-coding a list of specific types.

- Undo not found logging, since we cannot differentiate between existence
  checking and actual resolving, this spams the logs for no benefit.


2.6.4 (2015-07-27)
------------------

- Log when a resource is not found.


2.6.3 (2015-06-23)
------------------

  completes in production (VIV-584).

- Isolate tests against real DAV servers by using a dedicated, temporary test
  folder.


2.5.0 (2015-01-12)
------------------

- Store last access times for property and childname cache, too (VIV-584).


2.4.0 (2014-12-17)
------------------

- Filesystem connector now handles directory-type resources (especially:
  ImageGroups) like the DAV connector does: their uniqueId gets a trailing
  slash.


2.3.5 (2014-12-04)
------------------

- Brown-bag release.


2.3.4 (2014-10-21)
------------------

- Update dependency to ZODB-4.0.


2.3.3 (2014-03-26)
------------------

- Handle image groups in filesystem connector.


2.3.2 (2014-03-21)
------------------

- Fix bug in handling non-existent resources in filesystem connector:
  don't pass along OSError, but raise the proper KeyError.


2.3.1 (2014-03-14)
------------------

- Add a second image to the testcontent fixture, as they are really hard to create on the fly.


2.3 (2014-02-11)
----------------

- Fixed an interface declaration.

- Added a ZCML file for configuring a plain caching DAV connector.

- Replaced the non-caching DAV connector with one that uses transaction-bound
  caches. (#FRIED-31)


2.2 (2014-01-26)
----------------

- Add a non-caching DAV connector. (#FRIED-31)

- Add a read-only filesystem connector that uses a directory tree of XML files
  as its data storage. The mock connector now derives from the filesystem
  connector.


2.1.0 (2014-01-07)
------------------

- Make repository path configurable on mock connector.

- Add workaround for rankedTags property to mock connector.


2.0.4 (2013-11-17)
------------------

- Add ``testing`` folder to mock connector data for uniformity with real
  connector tests.


2.0.3 (2013-09-24)
------------------

- Fix test setup after removal of unittest2.


2.0.2 (2013-09-24)
------------------

- Fix quoting of entities (``&amp;``) in URLs (#8575).


2.0.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Fix tests for Python 2.7


2.0 (2013-04-23)
----------------

- Added clean-up for MOVE on abort: A MOVE is un-done by the reverse MOVE
  operation on transaction abort. (#12252)

- Added automagic conflict resolution for MOVE (#12139)


1.26.0 (2012-12-17)
-------------------

- Include new required properties in the test content fixture.
- Silence the mock connector 'searching...' messages.


1.25.1 (2012-03-06)
-------------------

- Added random value to mock connector's etag generator as subsequent calls to
  ``time.time()`` may the same value.

(NOTE: This version should have bevome 1.24.1. But once released we are not
retracting).


1.24.0 (2012-03-01)
-------------------

- Update mock fixture: DailyNL has moved to the 'document' namespace (#10056).

- Fix connector.txt test which (probably) broker after the last DAV server
  update (#10337)

- Fix search test which expected a result from the server which is not strictly
  necessary (#10339).

- Removed flaky threading test which was not actually useful because of a
  different database behaviour in test vs. production (#10352)


1.23.1 (2012-01-18)
-------------------

- Fix unicode error in search by encoding unicode to utf8.


1.23.0 (2011-11-13)
-------------------

- Fix decoding of URLs in DAVResponse when there is raw UTF8 in the xml
  (instead of fully url encoded).
- Corrected Logging of query-server queries (#8308)
- Pass lock-token for MOVE (#8980).
- Fix query server integration: The API implemented ``range()`` while it must
  read ``between()``.
- Raise exception in connector when query server returns an error.
- Allow to store strucured (XML) values in properties (#9899)


1.22.2 (2010-08-30)
-------------------

- Connector invalidation event subscriber doesn't raise ValueError any longer
  for UniqueIds the connector isn't responsible for (#7933)


1.22.1 (2010-08-17)
-------------------

- Fixed cache invalidation for collections with non-collection ids (#7906).


1.22.0 (2010-08-16)
-------------------

- When the cache is invalidated it only causes write request when there
  actually was a change. Before cached data was thrown away and stored in any
  case (#7797).


1.21.0 (2010-07-06)
-------------------

- Set the UUID via a custom header on PUT (#7366).

- MOVE is now doing a MOVE instead of COPY+DELETE (#7440)


1.20.1 (2010-06-09)
-------------------

- Rename supports renaming to ids with non-us-ascii chars (#7405)
- Correctly escape # in ids (#6042).
- Using versions from the ZTK.


1.20.0 (2010-01-18)
-------------------

- Do not sweep cache automatically. This should be done via a cronjob.


1.19.3 (2009-10-08)
-------------------

- Don't raise a PreconditionFailedError when the body of the stored resource 
  matches the to-be-written body. This is to support ZODB conflict errors
  without DAV having transactions.

- Fixed level 3 tests.


1.19.2 (2009-09-29)
-------------------

- Mock connector behaves more like the real one in regard to conflicts and
  etag preconditions.


1.19.1 (2009-09-28)
-------------------

- Removed a savepoint to avoid garbage collection which lead to LockingErrors.
  Note that this probably is a ZODB bug we're working around here.


1.19 (2009-09-24)
-----------------

- Honour the ETAG for PUT requests so there is a way to detect conflicts.

- Refactored DAV exceptions and exception handling to get this mor straight.

- Autolocks when adding content are immeadeately removed when there was an
  error during PUT or PROPPATCH.

1.18.4 (2009-09-21)
-------------------

- PROPPATCH on a locked resource raises correct DAVLockedError (#6237).


1.18.3 (2009-09-06)
-------------------

- Fixed test as content changes.


1.18.2 (2009-09-01)
-------------------

- Fixed Property conflict resolution with ZODB 3.9.0c


1.18.1 (2009-08-18)
-------------------

- Python 2.6 compatibility.

1.18 (2009-08-14)
-----------------

- There was a chance that cache inconsitencies could yield a KeyError: "The
  resource xzy does not exist." (#5993).

1.17.1 (2009-08-05)
-------------------

- Refactored body cache to no longer reuse blobs for even better conflict
  resolution.

1.17 (2009-07-24)
-----------------

- Fixed an issue with vanishing Blob files sending a POSKeyError to the user.

- Refactored body cache store Body objects which do conflict resolution. This
  way two threads storing the same body don't generate a conflict.

1.16.1 (2099-07-23)
-------------------

- Fixed a unicode bug in cache (related to #5580).

1.16 (2009-07-23)
-----------------

- Reuse Blobs instead of creating new ones when updating resources (#5580).

- Don't fail in abort clean up when a lock has timed out (#5578).

1.15.1 (2009-06-25)
-------------------

- Make sure no SecurityProxies are tried to be stored as cache keys.

1.15 (2009-06-24)
-----------------

- Support UTF8 characters in URLs (#5534).

- Make less HEAD requests.

- Don't send full URLs in the request to the DAV as HTTP/1.1 actually want's
  paths.

1.14.4 (2009-06-19)
-------------------

- SecurityProxy-Fehler im Cache behoben (maximum recursion depth exceeded)

1.14.3 (2009-06-18)
-------------------

- Repackaged (setupools/svn 1.6 problem).

1.14.2 (2009-06-18)
-------------------

- Fixed bug in mock connector: last-modified property is now set with timezone
  UTC.

- Use only one way to change properties.

1.14.1 (2009-06-15)
-------------------

- Make sure we really read all the bodies at the right time.

1.14 (2009-06-15)
-----------------

- Cache invalidaion is smarter now. This allows processing larger amounts of
  invalidation events without the knowledge about the kind of the change
  (delete, add, ...).

- Do not operate on paths and URLs but only pass URLs to the WebDAV server.

- When a PROPFIND is not finished by Apache because of an error, the connector
  waits a bit and retries the request.

- Refactored code to make it cleaner. Also do less HEAD requests.

1.13 (2009-06-04)
-----------------

- Made sure the {INTERNAL}cached-time is not stored on the DAV.

- Fixed a bug in the property cache conflict resolver which took the
  cached-time into account.

1.12 (2009-06-03)
-----------------

- Relatexed othersystem locks: If there is a lock the connector doesn't know
  about, but knows about the locking user id (principal), it considers the lock
  as if it was the connectors lock (#4996).

1.11.1 (2009-05-15)
-------------------

- Alle ``test.py`` nach ``tests.py`` umbenannt.

1.11 (2009-04-23)
-----------------

- The lock time out now works also with the property cache. Locks were just not
  timing out when using the fully integrated connector (fixes #4997).

1.10 (2009-04-09)
-----------------

- Fixed "AttributeError: 'BTrees.OOBTree.OOTreeSet' object has no attribute
  'add'" which occured on existing databases.

- Fixed refresh-cache to not fail with a bogus property cache.

- Improved ConflictResolution so equal states are kept instead of thrown away.

1.9 (2009-04-08)
----------------

- Added conflict resolution for the PropertyCache and ChildIdCache. This
  hopefully leads to less conflicts.

- Added an invalidtor runner which refreshes the whole property cache.

1.8 (2009-04-07)
----------------

- Connector knows of lock timeouts now (fixes #4914).

1.7 (2009-03-23)
----------------

- CachedResource now returns a read-only property object (fixes #3869).

1.6.5 (2009-03-04)
------------------

- Mock-Connector returns correct getlastmodified.

1.6.4 (2009-01-19)
------------------

- Fixed a bug in child-id cache which led to an invalid list of child ids in
  some circumstances (like with the preview objects).

1.6.3 (never released)
-----------------------

- 1.6.3 was never released because version was accidentally increased to 1.6.4.

1.6.2 (2008-12-12)
------------------

- Resources of null resource locks do not longer have the HTML 404 error
  message as body.
- Mock connector: Existing collections do have a getlastmodified property now.

1.6.1 (2008-11-28)
------------------

- Fixed threading test.

1.6 (2008-11-27)
----------------

- Set the referrer header to the URL the current interaction was created with.

1.5 (2008-11-24)
----------------

- Be smarter when invalidating folders when objects are added or deleted. This
  should lead to much better performance for adds/deletes.

1.4.7 (2008-11-20)
------------------

- No more test extra.
- Functional test layer can be torn down.

1.4.6 (2008-11-19)
------------------

- PropertyCache and ChildNameCache do not write data when the value is
  already stored in the cache. This should lead to fewer conflict errors.

1.4.5 (2008-08-12)
------------------

- Fixed a bug in the body cache which lead to a database write on cache read.

1.4.4 (2008-08-07)
------------------

- The discovery of the cannonical id of a resource does a HEAD request on the
  base url (w/o trailing slash) now. This leads to massively decreased 404's on
  the server.
- Removed auto-redirect in dav module as this was not required and just added
  complexity.
- Removed unnecessary PROPFIND's in dav module.
- Added a stress test which does property changes in parallel.

1.4.3 (2008-08-05)
------------------

- Changed the way the body cache keeps track of access times. The new way is
  hopefully less conflict prone.


1.4.2 (2008-08-05)
------------------

- When the connector invalidates resources, the're reloaded immedeately to
  have less conflict potential.

1.4.1 (2008-08-01)
------------------

- Made cache sweep more stable agains inconsistent data.

1.4 (2008-08-01)
----------------

- Empty WebDAV properties were returned as None and subsequently stored as
  'None' (fixes bug #4443).

1.3 (2008-07-29)
----------------

- Reverted changes from 1.2 and added a test to make sure the properties are in
  fact updated.

1.2 (2008-07-29)
----------------

- Do not re-set the property cache on ``changeProperties`` but just update.

1.1 (2008-07-24)
----------------

- Body-Cache doesn't store strings directly but via a persistent object.
- Use a Singleton class for webdav property keys.
- Body-Cache always returns an object which can be passed beyond the
  transaction boundary now.
- Mock stores Content-Type of resources now.

1.0 (2008-07-14)
----------------

- Only invalidate parent on adding resource when really necessary.

1.0b4 (2008-07-09)
------------------

- longrunning.txt did not reset DEBUG_CONNECTION.
- Removed conflict hotspot from property and child id cache.

1.0b3 (2008-07-04)
------------------

- Caches are using the plain unique id as cache key now (not reversed).
- Property-Cache reuses (name, namespace) tuples hand passes out references to
  the same tuples. This leads to having only one tuple instance per (name,
  namespace).
- PropertyCache stores the properties as OOBTree.
- ChildNameCache stores the childnames as TreeSet
- Small bodies (<=10 kB) are no longer stored as blob but as plain string.
- Fix for "BadStatusLine" which occours when the DAV server closes the
  connection.

1.0b2 (2008-06-28)
------------------

- Fixed handling on transaction abort so we're not writing to the database
  during "committing" phase.
- Removed property cache invalidation during server startup since this is just
  too heavy for production use.
- `changeProperties` doesn't invalidate the resource but updates the cache
  itself.
- Removed content migration script.

1.0b1 (2008-06-27)
------------------

- Using event system in ZopeConnector to invalidate caches.
- Fixed a bug when getting NULLResources or other resources w/o etag (bug
  #4315).
- Make sure connector continues to work when the connection gets into an
  inconsistent state (bug #4109).

0.22 (2008-06-23)
-----------------

- Mock: Allowed to get the root as resource.

0.21 (2008-06-16)
-----------------

- Make sure 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group' doesn't occur anymore.
- Make sure XML-like content can be put in a property by prefixing it. This is
  a temporary fix until it is decided what the DAV server will do in this case.
- Added a DataManager where the connector can register things to clean up on
  transaction abort.
- Sending User-Agent "zeit.connector"

0.20 (2008-06-10)
-----------------

- General code cleanup
- Explicitly reading all data from response instead of brutally closing the
  connection.
- Use lxml to generate xml instead of string-concatenation in most places.

0.19 (2008-05-23)
-----------------

- Fixed better lock handling from 0.17
- Only invalidating parent of a resource when parent actually has changed.

0.18 (2008-05-19)
-----------------

- Fixed a bug in the cache sweeping which did not remove the actual data.
- Diversified cache keys by reversing unique_id. Objects which are close in the
  tree should now be in differend BTree buckets.

0.17 (2008-05-19)
-----------------

- Better lock handling: always look for definete information on the server
  before locking/unlocking or doing anything with a lock. 
- Removed the live searching tests.

0.16 (2008-05-13)
-----------------

- Moved ZopeConnector to sperate module.
- Keep HTTP connection open for better performance. Connections will be closed
  at the end of the transaction (ZopeConnector).

0.15 (2008-04-28)
-----------------

- Fixed a bug in copy code which was not invalidating the caches correctly.

0.14 (2008-04-22)
-----------------

- `zeit.connector.connector.Connector` doesn't use the component architecture
  now. This makes it easier to use in console scripts.
- <feed> is now <channel> (mock connector).
- connector's move method uses copy+delete now
- Added copy method to IConnector which allows copying files and directories.
- Enabled move to move directories.

0.13 (2008-04-07)
-----------------

- Made DeleteProperty a rock in the zope.security.

0.12 (2008-03-25)
-----------------

- Moved locktoken storage to a separate utility, out of a cache.
- Added events to notify caches about invalidated resources.
