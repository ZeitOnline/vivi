  playlists and videos.

- Change indexes as the interface requires an solr attribute now (for #8559)

- Adapted last_semantic_change from date_last_modified
- Use an empty string instead of null in REST calls for brightcove does not
  recognize null

- Add a solr index 'h264_url' that contains the 'flv_url' of the video (#7362).
- Change update-repository to be long-running instead of one-shot (#7339).
- Provide an adapter to ITimeBasedPublishing, so videos get an expires
  attribute when included in a centerpage (#7335).
- Allow both videos and playlists as assets (#7195).
- Prefix the IDs of video/playlist assets in XML (vid123/pls987) (#7194).
- Add expires attribute to asset XML-references (#7380).


0.3.2 (2010-05-06)
------------------

- Explicitly index solr instead of modified event which causes the modification
  time to change.


0.3.1 (2010-05-06)
------------------

- Do not unconditionally delete all playlists from solr but only those we know
  about but brightcove doesn't know about.

- Update solr synchronously. The async updating was not intentional.


0.3.0 (2010-05-03)
------------------

- The repository does not access the Brightcove API directly anymore, it only
  functions as a local cache. It is populated periodically by cron (Solr is
  updated then, too, as a "byproduct"). (#7150, #7163)


0.2.1 (2010-04-27)
------------------

- Fully implement IPublishInfo interface for videos and playlist.


0.2.0 (2010-04-22)

- IReferenceProvider adapted, which returns a list of IBCContent
  (to avoid API-Calls)

  timeouts

------------------

- brightcove will delete all videos with state != ACTIVE from internal and
  public solr
