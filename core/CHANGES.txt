CHANGES
=======

1.22.1 (unreleased)
-------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.22.0 (2010-08-16)
-------------------

- When the cache is invalidated it only causes write request when there
  actually was a change. Before cached data was thrown away and stored in any
  case (#7797).


1.21.0 (2010-07-06)
-------------------

- Set the UUID via a custom header on PUT (#7366).

- MOVE is now doing a MOVE instead of COPY+DELETE (#7440)


1.20.1 (2010-06-09)
-------------------

- Rename supports renaming to ids with non-us-ascii chars (#7405)
- Correctly escape # in ids (#6042).
- Using versions from the ZTK.


1.20.0 (2010-01-18)
-------------------

- Do not sweep cache automatically. This should be done via a cronjob.


1.19.3 (2009-10-08)
-------------------

- Don't raise a PreconditionFailedError when the body of the stored resource 
  matches the to-be-written body. This is to support ZODB conflict errors
  without DAV having transactions.

- Fixed level 3 tests.


1.19.2 (2009-09-29)
-------------------

- Mock connector behaves more like the real one in regard to conflicts and
  etag preconditions.


1.19.1 (2009-09-28)
-------------------

- Removed a savepoint to avoid garbage collection which lead to LockingErrors.
  Note that this probably is a ZODB bug we're working around here.


1.19 (2009-09-24)
-----------------

- Honour the ETAG for PUT requests so there is a way to detect conflicts.

- Refactored DAV exceptions and exception handling to get this mor straight.

- Autolocks when adding content are immeadeately removed when there was an
  error during PUT or PROPPATCH.

1.18.4 (2009-09-21)
-------------------

- PROPPATCH on a locked resource raises correct DAVLockedError (#6237).


1.18.3 (2009-09-06)
-------------------

- Fixed test as content changes.


1.18.2 (2009-09-01)
-------------------

- Fixed Property conflict resolution with ZODB 3.9.0c


1.18.1 (2009-08-18)
-------------------

- Python 2.6 compatibility.

1.18 (2009-08-14)
-----------------

- There was a chance that cache inconsitencies could yield a KeyError: "The
  resource xzy does not exist." (#5993).

1.17.1 (2009-08-05)
-------------------

- Refactored body cache to no longer reuse blobs for even better conflict
  resolution.

1.17 (2009-07-24)
-----------------

- Fixed an issue with vanishing Blob files sending a POSKeyError to the user.

- Refactored body cache store Body objects which do conflict resolution. This
  way two threads storing the same body don't generate a conflict.

1.16.1 (2099-07-23)
-------------------

- Fixed a unicode bug in cache (related to #5580).

1.16 (2009-07-23)
-----------------

- Reuse Blobs instead of creating new ones when updating resources (#5580).

- Don't fail in abort clean up when a lock has timed out (#5578).

1.15.1 (2009-06-25)
-------------------

- Make sure no SecurityProxies are tried to be stored as cache keys.

1.15 (2009-06-24)
-----------------

- Support UTF8 characters in URLs (#5534).

- Make less HEAD requests.

- Don't send full URLs in the request to the DAV as HTTP/1.1 actually want's
  paths.

1.14.4 (2009-06-19)
-------------------

- SecurityProxy-Fehler im Cache behoben (maximum recursion depth exceeded)

1.14.3 (2009-06-18)
-------------------

- Repackaged (setupools/svn 1.6 problem).

1.14.2 (2009-06-18)
-------------------

- Fixed bug in mock connector: last-modified property is now set with timezone
  UTC.

- Use only one way to change properties.

1.14.1 (2009-06-15)
-------------------

- Make sure we really read all the bodies at the right time.

1.14 (2009-06-15)
-----------------

- Cache invalidaion is smarter now. This allows processing larger amounts of
  invalidation events without the knowledge about the kind of the change
  (delete, add, ...).

- Do not operate on paths and URLs but only pass URLs to the WebDAV server.

- When a PROPFIND is not finished by Apache because of an error, the connector
  waits a bit and retries the request.

- Refactored code to make it cleaner. Also do less HEAD requests.

1.13 (2009-06-04)
-----------------

- Made sure the {INTERNAL}cached-time is not stored on the DAV.

- Fixed a bug in the property cache conflict resolver which took the
  cached-time into account.

1.12 (2009-06-03)
-----------------

- Relatexed othersystem locks: If there is a lock the connector doesn't know
  about, but knows about the locking user id (principal), it considers the lock
  as if it was the connectors lock (#4996).

1.11.1 (2009-05-15)
-------------------

- Alle ``test.py`` nach ``tests.py`` umbenannt.

1.11 (2009-04-23)
-----------------

- The lock time out now works also with the property cache. Locks were just not
  timing out when using the fully integrated connector (fixes #4997).

1.10 (2009-04-09)
-----------------

- Fixed »AttributeError: 'BTrees.OOBTree.OOTreeSet' object has no attribute
  'add'« which occured on existing databases.

- Fixed refresh-cache to not fail with a bogus property cache.

- Improved ConflictResolution so equal states are kept instead of thrown away.

1.9 (2009-04-08)
----------------

- Added conflict resolution for the PropertyCache and ChildIdCache. This
  hopefully leads to less conflicts.

- Added an invalidtor runner which refreshes the whole property cache.

1.8 (2009-04-07)
----------------

- Connector knows of lock timeouts now (fixes #4914).

1.7 (2009-03-23)
----------------

- CachedResource now returns a read-only property object (fixes #3869).

1.6.5 (2009-03-04)
------------------

- Mock-Connector returns correct getlastmodified.

1.6.4 (2009-01-19)
------------------

- Fixed a bug in child-id cache which led to an invalid list of child ids in
  some circumstances (like with the preview objects).

1.6.3 (never released)
-----------------------

- 1.6.3 was never released because version was accidentally increased to 1.6.4.

1.6.2 (2008-12-12)
------------------

- Resources of null resource locks do not longer have the HTML 404 error
  message as body.
- Mock connector: Existing collections do have a getlastmodified property now.

1.6.1 (2008-11-28)
------------------

- Fixed threading test.

1.6 (2008-11-27)
----------------

- Set the referrer header to the URL the current interaction was created with.

1.5 (2008-11-24)
----------------

- Be smarter when invalidating folders when objects are added or deleted. This
  should lead to much better performance for adds/deletes.

1.4.7 (2008-11-20)
------------------

- No more test extra.
- Functional test layer can be torn down.

1.4.6 (2008-11-19)
------------------

- PropertyCache and ChildNameCache do not write data when the value is
  already stored in the cache. This should lead to fewer conflict errors.

1.4.5 (2008-08-12)
------------------

- Fixed a bug in the body cache which lead to a database write on cache read.

1.4.4 (2008-08-07)
------------------

- The discovery of the cannonical id of a resource does a HEAD request on the
  base url (w/o trailing slash) now. This leads to massively decreased 404's on
  the server.
- Removed auto-redirect in dav module as this was not required and just added
  complexity.
- Removed unnecessary PROPFIND's in dav module.
- Added a stress test which does property changes in parallel.

1.4.3 (2008-08-05)
------------------

- Changed the way the body cache keeps track of access times. The new way is
  hopefully less conflict prone.


1.4.2 (2008-08-05)
------------------

- When the connector invalidates resources, the're reloaded immedeately to
  have less conflict potential.

1.4.1 (2008-08-01)
------------------

- Made cache sweep more stable agains inconsistent data.

1.4 (2008-08-01)
----------------

- Empty WebDAV properties were returned as None and subsequently stored as
  'None' (fixes bug #4443).

1.3 (2008-07-29)
----------------

- Reverted changes from 1.2 and added a test to make sure the properties are in
  fact updated.

1.2 (2008-07-29)
----------------

- Do not re-set the property cache on ``changeProperties`` but just update.

1.1 (2008-07-24)
----------------

- Body-Cache doesn't store strings directly but via a persistent object.
- Use a Singleton class for webdav property keys.
- Body-Cache always returns an object which can be passed beyond the
  transaction boundary now.
- Mock stores Content-Type of resources now.

1.0 (2008-07-14)
----------------

- Only invalidate parent on adding resource when really necessary.

1.0b4 (2008-07-09)
------------------

- longrunning.txt did not reset DEBUG_CONNECTION.
- Removed conflict hotspot from property and child id cache.

1.0b3 (2008-07-04)
------------------

- Caches are using the plain unique id as cache key now (not reversed).
- Property-Cache reuses (name, namespace) tuples hand passes out references to
  the same tuples. This leads to having only one tuple instance per (name,
  namespace).
- PropertyCache stores the properties as OOBTree.
- ChildNameCache stores the childnames as TreeSet
- Small bodies (<=10 kB) are no longer stored as blob but as plain string.
- Fix for "BadStatusLine" which occours when the DAV server closes the
  connection.

1.0b2 (2008-06-28)
------------------

- Fixed handling on transaction abort so we're not writing to the database
  during "committing" phase.
- Removed property cache invalidation during server startup since this is just
  too heavy for production use.
- `changeProperties` doesn't invalidate the resource but updates the cache
  itself.
- Removed content migration script.

1.0b1 (2008-06-27)
------------------

- Using event system in ZopeConnector to invalidate caches.
- Fixed a bug when getting NULLResources or other resources w/o etag (bug
  #4315).
- Make sure connector continues to work when the connection gets into an
  inconsistent state (bug #4109).

0.22 (2008-06-23)
-----------------

- Mock: Allowed to get the root as resource.

0.21 (2008-06-16)
-----------------

- Make sure 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group' doesn't occur anymore.
- Make sure XML-like content can be put in a property by prefixing it. This is
  a temporary fix until it is decided what the DAV server will do in this case.
- Added a DataManager where the connector can register things to clean up on
  transaction abort.
- Sending User-Agent "zeit.connector"

0.20 (2008-06-10)
-----------------

- General code cleanup
- Explicitly reading all data from response instead of brutally closing the
  connection.
- Use lxml to generate xml instead of string-concatenation in most places.

0.19 (2008-05-23)
-----------------

- Fixed better lock handling from 0.17
- Only invalidating parent of a resource when parent actually has changed.

0.18 (2008-05-19)
-----------------

- Fixed a bug in the cache sweeping which did not remove the actual data.
- Diversified cache keys by reversing unique_id. Objects which are close in the
  tree should now be in differend BTree buckets.

0.17 (2008-05-19)
-----------------

- Better lock handling: always look for definete information on the server
  before locking/unlocking or doing anything with a lock. 
- Removed the live searching tests.

0.16 (2008-05-13)
-----------------

- Moved ZopeConnector to sperate module.
- Keep HTTP connection open for better performance. Connections will be closed
  at the end of the transaction (ZopeConnector).

0.15 (2008-04-28)
-----------------

- Fixed a bug in copy code which was not invalidating the caches correctly.

0.14 (2008-04-22)
-----------------

- `zeit.connector.connector.Connector` doesn't use the component architecture
  now. This makes it easier to use in console scripts.
- <feed> is now <channel> (mock connector).
- connector's move method uses copy+delete now
- Added copy method to IConnector which allows copying files and directories.
- Enabled move to move directories.

0.13 (2008-04-07)
-----------------

- Made DeleteProperty a rock in the zope.security.

0.12 (2008-03-25)
-----------------

- Moved locktoken storage to a separate utility, out of a cache.
- Added events to notify caches about invalidated resources.
