zeit.brightcove changes
=======================

2.1.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


2.1.0 (2011-12-01)
------------------

- Use separate Remotetask service for publishing BC objects (#10024).

- When importing from BC, also publish videos/playlists when they already are
  published but have been changed in DAV (#10023).

- When updating from BC, delete playlists in two phases in order to play nice
  with asynchronous publication (retraction) (#10022).


2.0.1 (2011-11-23)
------------------

- Import and export references (#9831).

- Fix change detection of playlists (#9976)

- Remove bits and pieces which try to save playlists back to brightcove:
  playlists are not changed in the CMS so there is no need to actually update
  brightcove.

- Map brightcove release date correcly to date first released.

- Default Daily Newsletter to false for videos.

- Move serie source to zeit.content.video.

- BC-Deleted videos are now retracted in one pass and deleted in a second
  pass. This means that they are actually being retracted.

- BC-Inactive videos are now kept in the CMS as unpublished objects.


2.0.0 (2011-11-13)
------------------

- Impport videos and playlists into the DAV servers (#8996).

- Add backward compatibility adapters for old video and playlist unique Ids
  (#9746).


0.10.0 (2011-08-12)
-------------------

- added mediadeliverymethod in connection.


0.9.1 (2011-04-29)
------------------

- Add timeout for all Brightcove requests (#8021).


0.9.0 (2011-03-23)
------------------

- Changed mapping for ``last-semantic-change`` to ``date_first_released``

- Videos can be checked out now by the system. This allows to create free
  teasers of videos (for #7826).

- Extracted ``get_expires`` to get the me earliest expires date from a list of
  playlists and videos.

- Change indexes as the interface requires an solr attribute now (for #8559)

- Remove Brightcove content from addcentral.


0.8.0 (2010-08-16)
------------------

- New layout for video-form 

- Honour the default values of the interface in mapped properties.


0.7.0 (2010-08-09)
------------------

- Fix tests after changes in zeit.cms (#7549)
- changes some default values  
- Knopf für "Speichern und zur Suche" (#7827)

0.6.1 (2010-07-15)
------------------

- Fix brightove SOLR updater so it implements IUpdater correctly. Otherwise
  re-indexing videos doesn't work correctly.


0.6.0 (2010-07-12)
------------------

- Since brightcove caches absolute URLs better, we use the same timestamp for
  a request more often
- Use proper preview URL for brightcove content (#7030).
- Adapted last_semantic_change from date_last_modified
- Use an empty string instead of null in REST calls for brightcove does not
  recognize null
- Update brightcove videos if video_still is updated. Even though the
  modified_date is not updated, this might happen in upstream.  
- Add image-tag to video XML reference (#7625)
- Add type="video" attribute to video XML reference (#7625)


0.5.0 (2010-06-09)
------------------

- Added solr indexes for banner and banner-id (#7382).
- Update videos "latest modified first" (#7209).
- Add uniqueId to asset references (#7381).


0.4.1 (2010-06-03)
------------------

- Handle missing expire dates when writing asset references.
- Add id_prefix to the interface so it gets security clearance.


0.4.0 (2010-06-02)
------------------

- Add a solr index 'h264_url' that contains the 'flv_url' of the video (#7362).
- Change update-repository to be long-running instead of one-shot (#7339).
- Provide an adapter to ITimeBasedPublishing, so videos get an expires
  attribute when included in a centerpage (#7335).
- Allow both videos and playlists as assets (#7195).
- Prefix the IDs of video/playlist assets in XML (vid123/pls987) (#7194).
- Add expires attribute to asset XML-references (#7380).


0.3.2 (2010-05-06)
------------------

- Explicitly index solr instead of modified event which causes the modification
  time to change.


0.3.1 (2010-05-06)
------------------

- Do not unconditionally delete all playlists from solr but only those we know
  about but brightcove doesn't know about.

- Update solr synchronously. The async updating was not intentional.


0.3.0 (2010-05-03)
------------------

- The repository does not access the Brightcove API directly anymore, it only
  functions as a local cache. It is populated periodically by cron (Solr is
  updated then, too, as a "byproduct"). (#7150, #7163)


0.2.1 (2010-04-27)
------------------

- Fully implement IPublishInfo interface for videos and playlist.


0.2.0 (2010-04-22)
------------------

- videoIds in Playlists are a property
- added IBCContent between ICMSContent and IBrightcoveContent 
- IReferenceProvider adapted, which returns a list of IBCContent
  (to avoid API-Calls)
- set timdedelta for modified videos to 2hours. this decreases amount of
  timeouts

0.1.2 (2010-04-14)
------------------

- brightcove will delete all videos with state != ACTIVE from internal and
  public solr 


0.1.1 (2010-04-12)
------------------

- better handling for page iteration using brightcove API.


0.1.0 (2010-04-09)
------------------

- First release
