- Objects can be copied from clipboards again. (#9960)

- No longer log spurious errors when trying to fix up certain SOAP responses.
  (#10094)


0.4.3 (2011-11-14)

------------------

- Store claimable tokens as str instead of some strange SOAP data type.

------------------

- Report the freetext authors if no structured authors are available. VGWort
  will do some matching then.

- Report authors without vgwort id

  reporting.
